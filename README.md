Title: Currency Exchanger

Max Chang & Andy Kim

Team Name - Max & Andy

We are going to create a currency exchanger program using a python file and implementing it into java to calculate currency exchange rates from user input.

We chose to do this project because it'd be interesting to implement the currency exchanging program into java.

Max will work on python, Andy will work on calculation, and we'll both work on java program and UI. (Subject to Change)

Currencies: USD, EUR, CNY, KRW (Subject to change)
