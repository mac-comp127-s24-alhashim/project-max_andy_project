Title: Currency Exchanger

Max Chang & Andy Kim

Team Name - Max & Andy

We are going to create a currency exchanger program using a python file and implementing it into java to calculate currency exchange rates from user input.

When the user inputs the currency and the amount they want to exchange money from and the currency they want it to exchange to, then the program will print the amount of money exchanged and the exchange rate for the two currencies mentioned.

We decided to use data from a website showing the currency exchange rates and apply them to our project.

The website we used: https://www.x-rates.com/table/?from=USD&amount=1

Currencies: USD, EUR, SGD, JPY, CNY, CAD, AUD, RUB, MXN, INR
